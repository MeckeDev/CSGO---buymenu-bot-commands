# Description
Never used Bot Commands? Nice, here's a smarter Way to use these Menu's.

I made some changes in the Radiopanel.txt to replace the Bot Commands with some useful Scripts.

# Example: 

Instead of telling a Bot he is useless, you could make a "Full Buy"

I press "Z" and "1" on my Keyboard and i instantly get:

AK/M4
Desert Eagle
Flash
HE
Molotov/Incendiary
Smoke
Vest/Helmet
Defuse Kit

# How to install

Just replace your old Radiopanel.txt with my new Radiopanel.txt

You will find your Radiopanel.txt here: ..\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\resource\ui\
